## Running graph_clustering.ipynb

This `graph_clustering.ipynb` script contains all necessary information to run the clustering algorithm on NC counties. As we have made use of the `pytidycensus` package to import census and geographic data for counties, no additional data sources are needed. 

### Requirements

The required python libraries to run the script are:

- Pandas
- Geopandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- pytidycensus
- networkx
- sklearn
